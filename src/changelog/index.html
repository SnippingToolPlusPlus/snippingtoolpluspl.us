        <p>The current stable release is Snipping Tool++ <a href="#6.3.0">6.3.0</a>. Versions older than 6.0 can be found in the <a href="../downloads/archives/">archives</a>.</p>

        <p>Notice: Unfortunately we do not have a change log history for versions older than 5.0.1</p>

        <h2><a name="6.3.0"></a><a href="../downloads/SnippingToolPlusPlus-6.3.0.zip">6.3.0</a> <em>Latest Stable Release</em></h2>
        <h3>New Features!</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Customizeable Hotkey Support! - Now you can customize the hotkeys for your own personal needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>General Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Improved the Editor keybinds, they shouldn't be as finicky anymore and using CTRL+C in the Editor should only make a single copy and not multiple.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a major memory issue that would cause Snipping Tool++ to eventually use up to 500mb of RAM or more. This has been addressed, the tool shouldn't use more than 150mb and most of that is just allocated memory for the JVM that's not actually being used</li>
          <li>Fixed the donate link on the donate button in the task trays right click menu</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue that was causing the upload finished ding to not play at the correct time</li>
          <li>Fixed a bounds issue when updating the overlay screenshot with middle mouse click</li>
          <li>Fixed some grammar issues in the keysets help page</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Magnifying Glass - When in the overlay you can enable/disable the magnifying glass with [Right Mouse Click].

NOTE: To change the overlay transparency, disable the Magnifying Glass with [Right Mouse Click] then use the [Scrollwheel] to increase/decrease transparency.</li>
          <li>Master Hotkey - A master hotkey [PRINT SCREEN] can be used to bring up the upload overlay. This can be used instead of the
          default [CTL+SHIFT] modified hotkeys until we get customizable hotkeys in.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>General Improvements</h3>
        <ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Cloud Based Upload History - No accounts or personal information required!<br><br>To access this feature you need to register a unique keyset that will be used to sign your uploaded images so to speak.

This keyset can be saved to a file which you can import if needed.<br><br>You can view the images signed with your keyset using the [Utilities > Capture Viewer] on any computer that has a Snipping Tool++ client using your unique keyset.</li>
          <li>Expect more uploading and statistic oriented features in future updates!</li>

	      <h3>Bug Fixes!</h3>
        <ul>
